7. foresight.js (https://github.com/adamdbradley/foresight.js)
Foresight.js gives webpages the ability to tell if the user's device is capable of viewing 
high-resolution images (such as the 3rd generation iPad) before the image is requested from the server. 
Additionally, it judges if the user's device currently has a fast enough network connection for high-resolution images. 
Depending on device display and network connectivity, foresight.js will request the appropriate image for the webpage
8. A state manager for CSS media queries
